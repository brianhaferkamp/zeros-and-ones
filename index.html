After the heights of 2013-2014, market share has steadily decreased, including <a href="http://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/e-book-sales-decline-18-3-in-may-2016" target="_blank">an 18% decrease in May 2016</a>.</p><a href="http://goodereader.com/blog/uploads/images/20161115aappressreleasechart.png" target="_blank"><img src="http://goodereader.com/blog/uploads/images/20161115aappressreleasechart.png" alt="Chart showing book market share by type from 2011-2016, with eBook market share declining since 2014" title="Chart showing sales of books by type, with eBook market share declining since 2014"/></a><cite><a href="http://goodereader.com/blog/e-book-news/e-book-sales-decline-18-3-in-may-2016" target="_blank">From GoodReads.com</a></cite><p>It's hard to tell if this decline is for reading digital content altogether or if people just don't want to pay for eBooks. When I look out, I see a proprietary landscape full of uni-functional eReading devices that are controlled by a few companies. But when I look out at the rest of the digital world, I see a plethora of devices that can use apps and browsers. Because of the proprietary nature of eReaders, people must choose which platform they will "go with" as their preferred eBook solution.</p><p>In response to this proprietary problem, I'm presenting uBooks (Universal Books). They are web-based, browser-based alternatives to what we have always known as platform-specific eBooks (files that end with .mobi, .epub, etc).</p><p>You might be thinking, "Okay, great. What is a uBook?"</p><p>A uBook is essentially a website or web app that holds the content of a single, full book. It offers navigation and features chapters or divisions, just like an historic eBook. The advantages of the open web over proprietary eBook systems that we have now are numerous. Here are some of the best ones I've thought of:</p><ul><li>Cross-platform</li><li>Cross-browser</li><li>Offline capable</li><li>No reliance on proprietary marketplaces</li><li>No download necessary</li><li>SEO-friendly</li><li>Mobile-first/Responsive</li><li>Small (Light)</li><li>Fast</li><li>Simple codebase for developers</li><li>No sacrifice in UI/UX</li><li>Media features are powerful and easy to implement</li><li>Searchable</li><li>Compatible with a CMS (e.g., WordPress)</li><li>Can be printed</li><li>Capable of being divided in multiple ways (1-page or multi-page)</li><li>One base form can hold multiple types of content</li><li>Using one code base, the book can be internationalized (translated) into multiple languages</li></ul><p>It seems no good to tout such an idea without creating a demo first, so I created a demo that you can view here:</p><a href="https://brianhaferkamp.github.io/mobydick/" target="_blank">Read <em>Moby Dick</em> online</a><p></p></article></article><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script><script src="assets/js/app.js"></script></body>
